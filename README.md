Machine learning project that predicts diseases based on patient symptoms using Python, Pandas, and accuracy
# Disease Prediction Using Symptoms

## Overview
This project predicts diseases based on patient symptoms using a machine learning model.  
It classifies common diseases like Flu, Cold, and Migraine from input symptoms such as Fever, Cough, Fatigue, and Headache.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, accuracy_score, matplotlib  
- **Machine Learning Model:** Decision Tree Classifier  
- **Development Environment:** Google Colab  

## Dataset
- Contains patient symptoms and corresponding diagnosed diseases.  
- Sample features:
  - Fever
  - Cough
  - Fatigue
  - Headache  
- Labels represent diagnosed disease (e.g., Flu, Cold, Migraine).

## How It Works
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare symptom data for modeling.  
2. **Model Training:** Train a Decision Tree classifier on historical patient data.  
3. **Prediction:** Input new patient symptoms to predict the most probable disease.  
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate model accuracy using metrics like accuracy score and confusion matrix.

## output

- Predicts diseases for new patients based on their symptoms.
- Generates a trained machine learning model (decision_tree_model.pkl) for future predictions.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more symptoms and disease categories.
- Use advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for better accuracy.
- Deploy as a web app or chatbot for user-friendly interface.
